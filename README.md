This analog calculator performs operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and radication using only analog devices. A circuit is designed to select the operation according to the BODMAS rule, with selection managed by a multiplexer and controlled by code. The user inputs the operation via an app, and the command is sent wirelessly through the HC-05 Bluetooth module for execution.
